# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-and-NLP

This Project uses a combination of neural networks and NLP to process and predict the authenticity of the news headlines determining whether the news is fake or real. The dataset used to train the model was selected from Kaggle.

To understand more about the code,different neural network architectures and its working, check out this survey paper written by me: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3769884
